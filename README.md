## aim
The aim of this project is to design a keypad-based calculator using the PIC16F877A microcontroller with a 16×2 LCD in 4-bit mode. It reads user input from a 4×4 keypad, performs basic arithmetic operations, and displays the results on the LCD. This project demonstrates practical interfacing of input and output devices with a microcontroller.
